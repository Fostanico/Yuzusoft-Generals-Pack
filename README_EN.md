## About This Repository

This is the **public GitHub release repository** for the Yuzusoft Generals Pack.

This repository is mainly used to:

- publish and archive public versions for players;
- provide an alternative download channel for players who cannot use Steam Workshop normally;
- preserve public release files and version information;
- provide project information, installation instructions, compatibility notes, and feedback channels.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This repository is not the development team's primary repository.**
>
> Development, code refactoring, internal testing, branch management, and team collaboration take place in a separate private development repository.
> Therefore, the commit history here does not fully represent the actual development process of the Yuzusoft Generals Pack and should not be treated as a complete development log.

If you simply want to play the mod, Steam Workshop is recommended. Use this repository if Steam downloads are inconvenient, if you need a manual installation, or if you want to preserve a specific public version.

## Mod Overview

The Yuzusoft Generals Pack began as a mod that added Yuzusoft characters to Hearts of Iron IV. It has since grown into a comprehensive fan mod featuring characters, national mechanics, decisions, events, and custom UI.

Current highlights include:

- generals, advisors, and country leaders from multiple Yuzusoft titles;
- selected characters from `9-nine-` and `NOeSIS`;
- UI-based character recruitment;
- affection and marriage systems;
- numerous character events, marriage super events, and Easter eggs;
- character-specific upgrades, missions, and decisions;
- Yuzusoft-themed army, navy, and air manufacturers;
- expanded industry, military academy, and military reform mechanics;
- tarot cards and other randomized bonuses;
- special units, equipment, and character-related enhancements;
- multiple custom GUIs;
- ongoing remakes of characters and mechanics from older versions.

For the complete gameplay guide, character list, and latest update notes, please refer to the Steam Workshop page.

1. download this repository as a ZIP file;
2. extract it locally;
3. place the mod files in the Hearts of Iron IV local mod directory;

## What Is the Difference Between Steam and GitHub?

### Steam Workshop

Suitable for players who:

- want automatic updates;
- do not want to manage files manually;
- want player-facing releases as soon as possible.

### GitHub

Suitable for players who:

- have trouble downloading from Steam Workshop;
- want to manually archive a specific public version;
- want to inspect public release files;
- need to install the mod manually;
- want to use Git for version archiving.

This GitHub repository **is not used for the full development workflow**. Do not judge how long a feature took to develop, who created it, or how many internal refactors it underwent solely from this public commit history.

## Game Version and Compatibility

The current `descriptor.mod` declares support for:

```text
Hearts of Iron IV 1.19.2.0
```

The mod contains many characters, decisions, events, custom GUIs, and shared scripts. When used alongside large HOI4 mods, possible conflicts include:

- GUI conflicts;
- overwritten shared definitions;
- character or country script conflicts;
- event ID or trigger conflicts;
- abnormal behavior in special mechanics;
- incompatibility after a game update.

When reporting a compatibility issue, please provide as much of the following information as possible:

```text
HOI4 Version:
Yuzusoft Generals Pack Version:
Other Enabled Mods:
Reproduction Steps:
Expected Behaviour:
Actual Behaviour:
Relevant error.log:
Screenshot / Save:
```

More complete information usually makes the issue easier to diagnose.
